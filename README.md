### 5. **Example Queries**
1. **Get all active listings in a category**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Listings
   WHERE category_id = 1 AND status = 'active';
   ```

2. **Get all images for a listing**:
   ```sql
   SELECT image_url FROM Images
   WHERE listing_id = 123;
   ```

3. **Get unread notifications for a user**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Notifications
   WHERE user_id = 456 AND is_read = FALSE;
   ```

---

### 6. **Next Steps**
1. **Wireframe Your App**:
   - Sketch out the user interface for key screens (e.g., home, listing details, user profile).

2. **Set Up Your Database**:
   - Create the tables and relationships in your chosen database.

3. **Develop Core Features**:
   - Start with user authentication, then move to listing and category management.

4. **Test and Iterate**:
   - Test your app with real users and gather feedback for improvements.
